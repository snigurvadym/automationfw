TESTS TO DEVELOP:
1. Test #1. Open Google. Search for “automation”. Open the first link
on search results page. Verify that title contains searched word
2. Test #2. Open Google. Search for “automation”. Verify that there is
expected domain (“testautomationday.com”) on search results
pages (page: 1-5).

Комменты:

- searchDomainWordInResultLinksAndPages() does not switch to page #2 (it jumped from the 1st to 3rd page at once during run)

[VS] - fixed, this was really my bug after refactoring;

- it is better to add .idea folder to .ignore
[VS] - I've removed IDEA project files;

- move .sh and .cmd files to separate folder
[VS] - I've moved these files into src\tools folder created;

- Incapsulation (add private, package-private to methods). for example DriverFactory
[VS] - updated access modifiers most of the fields and methods;

- Suggest to hide business login and technical implementation from searchDomainWordInResultLinksAndPages() method {for loop to some inner method}

- I would suggest remove "@Optional("1") int pageIndexFrom" and "@Optional("1") int resultLink"
[VS] - I've removed these two parameters;

- "page+1" could be changed by "page++" or "++page"
[VS] - I've updated logic properly;

- Suggest to remove Logs from Test layer to some inner layers
[VS] - I've removed log actions from the test scenarios.

- Locator is hardcoded inside code -> should be extracted as a field to top of the page (//*[@class='csb ch']/../../a[text()='"+index+"'])
[VS] - I've removed hardcoded logic and added list of the fields to find by page factory;

- Locator is not optimized (//*[@class='csb ch']/../../a[text()='"+index+"'])
[VS] - I've optimized xPath locator for this locator.

- I am not sure you need to scrollIntoView, as I know WebDriver does that itself
[VS] - I've removed method and action for scrolling.

- Could be good to split Google Page Object to Google page object and GoogleResultsPage page objects
[VS] - I've splitted this page into GoogleResultsPage and GoogleSearchPage as was suggested;

- could be good to use WebDriverManager (bonigarcia) to remove dependencies of chromeDriver, firefoxDriver and others. Independent of OSs.
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.github.bonigarcia</groupId>
        <artifactId>webdrivermanager</artifactId>
        <version>2.2.1</version>
    </dependency>
[VS] - I've added this dependency and use this factory and added usage of this library into browser implementations.

[OY] -Add and implement cucumber framework;
[VS] - added cucumber scenarios;
